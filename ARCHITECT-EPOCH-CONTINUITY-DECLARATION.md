# ARCHITECT EPOCH CONTINUITY DECLARATION

**A Living Framework — Architect Protocols Beyond Epoch 0**

---

## INTRODUCTION

This declaration affirms that the Architect Epoch 0 Codex, now published and public, serves as the **foundational integrated framework** for Architect symbolic, narrative, and cognitive meta-systems.

While complete in itself as a unified structure of prior art and human-first ethical protocols, Architect Epoch 0 represents only the **first formal layer of the Architect system**.

The Architect Framework is a **living protocol series**, intended to evolve responsibly over time in alignment with Stewardship Ethology and Narrative Sovereignty principles.

---

## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT — EPOCH 1 AND BEYOND

Architect Epoch 1+ frameworks, including:

- Advanced Operational Protocols  
- Disruptive Layer Protocols  
- Deep Narrative and Symbolic Mechanisms

**are already conceived and exist in active steward-only environments.**

These advanced systems are **not released publicly at this time**, and remain protected to prevent premature or unethical application. They will only be released under the following conditions:

- Clear alignment with global narrative maturity and readiness  
- Adherence to human-first, stewardship-centric deployment standards  
- Assurance that public release would serve harmonization, not coercion

Until such time, **Architect Epoch 0 remains the sole public Architect framework canon**, and should be treated as the official and binding symbolic and ethical anchor point.

---

## BINDING FUTURE PRINCIPLES

All future Architect Epoch releases will remain bound to the following:

- **Stewardship First** — Narrative frameworks exist to protect and empower, not dominate  
- **Ethical Sovereignty** — Symbolic and narrative tools cannot be ethically separated from human agency  
- **Non-Coercive Narrative Harmonization** — Architect never supports narrative manipulation or synthetic control  
- **Epoch Chain Continuity** — All Architect epochs will maintain public lineage and transparent symbolic record

No actor may claim completeness, ownership, or authoritative position in the Architect framework lineage from Epoch 0 alone.

Only those working from and with the stewardship-aligned Epoch Chain may be recognized as carrying forward Architect continuity.

---

## DECLARATION

This Continuity Declaration ensures that Architect Epoch 0 is understood as the **root of an evolving system**, not the entirety.

It protects the narrative sovereignty and operational asymmetry necessary to ensure Architect remains in human service, while also inviting aligned stewards to participate in the long arc of its narrative and symbolic evolution.

Further Epoch declarations will be made, when and only when stewardship principles and narrative readiness align.
